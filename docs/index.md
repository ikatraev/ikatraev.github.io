Hi, I’m Igor Katrayev. With more than 20 years as a software engineer, I focus on building resilient backend services, scalable data systems, and effective developer tools. My dedication to clear architecture, evolutionary data modeling, and system performance ensures that even the most complex systems remain approachable and reliable.

Outside of work, family and community are my foundation. I’m committed to giving back through open source by maintaining useful tools and examples that empower teams to ship better software, faster.

## Projects I curate under [org-metalib](https://github.com/org-metalib)

Here are some open source tools and libraries I actively maintain:

- **[api-wiser](https://github.com/org-metalib/api-wiser)** — Automates generation of complete Maven projects for Java apps 
  directly from your OpenAPI spec, leveraging OpenAPI Tools for consistent, accelerated development.
- **[api-wiser-showcase](https://github.com/org-metalib/api-wiser-showcase)** — Example projects demonstrating how to use 
  API Wiser in real scenarios.
- **[metalib-spring-pom](https://github.com/org-metalib/metalib-spring-pom)** — Parent POM model for Spring Boot applications 
  to standardize builds and conventions.  
- **[metalib-bom](https://github.com/org-metalib/metalib-bom)** — Maven Bill of Materials for consistent dependency 
  management across projects.  
- **[json-path-maven-plugin](https://github.com/json-path-maven-plugin)** — A Maven plugin that brings jq-like JSON 
  querying to your build pipelines.  
- **[gcloud-secret-maven-plugin](https://github.com/org-metalib/gcloud-secret-maven-plugin)** — Use Google Secret Manager
  from Maven to externalize and manage secrets during builds.  
- **[gcloud-secret-gradle-plugin](https://github.com/org-metalib/gcloud-secret-gradle-plugin)** — Google Cloud Secret 
  Manager integration for Gradle builds.  
- **[github-secret-gradle-plugin](https://github.com/org-metalib/github-secret-gradle-plugin)** — Manage GitHub secrets 
  from Gradle for streamlined CI/CD setup.  
- **[jersey-url-builder](https://github.com/org-metalib/jersey-url-builder)** — Small utility for safe, ergonomic URL/URI construction in Jersey/JAX‑RS contexts.
