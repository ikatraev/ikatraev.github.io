Hi, I’m Igor Katrayev—a passionate software engineer with 20+ years of experience building robust backend services, data systems, and developer tooling. I care deeply about clear architecture, evolutionary data modeling, performance, and making complex systems approachable and dependable.

Family and community keep me grounded, and open source is how I give back. I maintain practical tools and examples that help teams ship faster with confidence.

## Projects I curate under [org-metalib](https://github.com/org-metalib)

Here are some open source tools and libraries I actively maintain:

- **[api-wiser](https://github.com/org-metalib/api-wiser)** — Automates generation of complete Maven projects for Java apps 
  directly from your OpenAPI spec, leveraging OpenAPI Tools for consistent, accelerated development.
- **[api-wiser-showcase](https://github.com/org-metalib/api-wiser-showcase)** — Example projects demonstrating how to use 
  API Wiser in real scenarios.
- **[metalib-spring-pom](https://github.com/org-metalib/metalib-spring-pom)** — Parent POM model for Spring Boot applications 
  to standardize builds and conventions.  
- **[metalib-bom](https://github.com/org-metalib/metalib-bom)** — Maven Bill of Materials for consistent dependency 
  management across projects.  
- **[json-path-maven-plugin](https://github.com/json-path-maven-plugin)** — A Maven plugin that brings jq-like JSON 
  querying to your build pipelines.  
- **[gcloud-secret-maven-plugin](https://github.com/org-metalib/gcloud-secret-maven-plugin)** — Use Google Secret Manager
  from Maven to externalize and manage secrets during builds.  
- **[gcloud-secret-gradle-plugin](https://github.com/org-metalib/gcloud-secret-gradle-plugin)** — Google Cloud Secret 
  Manager integration for Gradle builds.  
- **[github-secret-gradle-plugin](https://github.com/org-metalib/github-secret-gradle-plugin)** — Manage GitHub secrets 
  from Gradle for streamlined CI/CD setup.
